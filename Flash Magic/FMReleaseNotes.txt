Version 0.05 beta
-----------------

- Rewrote internet functions in EmbeddedHints to ensure EmbeddedHints will work regardless of whether wininet.dll, rasapi32.dll and wsock32.dll is installed on the machine or not

- Optimized background thread in EmbeddedHints to only check for an internet connection if it is time to try and get more hints rather than once a second

- Modified EmbeddedHints so default hints and previously downloaded hints are shown if no internet connection detected.

- Modified EmbeddedHints so that new hints are fetched when a hint is clicked on, if it is time to get new hints.


Version 0.04 beta
-----------------

- Modified EmbeddedHints so that the Hints fail to start if wininet.dll is not present, rather than FlashMagic failing to start.

- Added "Reset" to the Options menu. Selecting it resets the main window and advanced options window

- Fixed bug in EmbeddedHints: if a downloaded hint has the same ID as a hint currently in use, the original hint was not replaced, so two copies of the same hint were shown in the application.

- Adjusted spacing of the lines in the EmbeddedHints so the bottom line does not look crushed.


Version 0.01 beta
-----------------

- The first beta version.


Known Issues
------------

- There are no known issues in this version.


Notes
-----

- DTR and RTS support for 89LV51Rx2 and 89V51Rx2 is EXPERIMENTAL

- It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that if using Windows95 or NT4, and baud rates higher than 19200, either verification is performed after programming the device or the checksums features is used. These versions of Windows appear to have reliability problems above that baud rate, and while Flash Magic retries failed commands, if a programming command fails in a certain way, incorrect data may be programmed.
